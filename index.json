Various approachs have been proposed to tackle the scattering issues. One can measure the transmission matrix of the scattering media in advance in order to compensate the scattering effect, yet this method relies heavily on the characterization of scattering media, making it time-comsuming and not general enough. Wavefront shaping is an optimization-algorithm based method that exploit no prior information of scattering media. Most off-the-self optimization algorithms focus on genetic algorithm and its variants. Genetic algorithm is one of the most powerful evolutionary algorithms that shares great popularity among industries. Here in this project we intent to compare the optimization performance in wavefront shaping using different evolutionary algorithms.\n   Figure 1. Wavefront Shaping by Genetic Algorithm     Figure 2.

Memory-effect based methods expoit the inherent correlation of incident tilted light and thus can realize instant imaging thorugh scattering media. Speckle deconvolution imaging through scattering media was proposed in 2016 for the first time and gains popularities these years in this field. To the best of our knowledge, this method has rarely been applied to fluorescence imaging in a reflective optical scheme. Here in this project we are showing some reconstruction results using polymer dots as fluorescence signal.\nThe schematic for deconvolution imaging through scattering media is presented in Figure 1.

However, it remains challenging to measure the dynamic changes in cerebral glucose. Here, we developed a near-infrared (NIR) optical transducer to sensitively monitor the glucose variations in cerebrospinal fluid in vivo. The transducer consists of an oxygen-sensitive nanoparticle combined with glucose oxidase (GOx), yielding highly sensitive NIR phosphorescence in response to blood glucose change. We demonstrated long-term continuous glucose monitoring by using the NIR transducer. After subcutaneous implantation, the glucose transducer provides a strong luminescence signal that can continuously monitor blood glucose fluctuations for weeks. By using the NIR emission of the transducer, we further observed abnormal dynamic changes in cerebrospinal fluid glucose and quantitatively assessed cerebral glucose uptake rates in transgenic mice bearing brain tumors. This study provides a promising method for the diagnosis of various metabolic diseases with altered glucose metabolism.","tags":[],"title":"Near-Infrared Optical Transducer for Dynamic Imaging of Cerebrospinal Fluid Glucose in Brain Tumor","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"OCT Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an optical instrument that can perform cross-sectional image of biological tissue within less than 10 micro axial resolution using broadband light waves (830nm) near infrared light. The beam is then split into two beams (reference beam and probe beam) by beam splitter. Probe beam reach to the target tissue while reference beam reach to the reference mirror at a known distance. The echo time delay of light reflected from various layer of target tissue is compared with the echo time delay of light reflected from the reference mirror. The interference is measured by a photodetector which produce a range of time delays for comparison. There are two main OCT technologies, time-domain OCT (TD-OCT) and Fourier-domain OCT (FD-OCT). In a TD-OCT measurement the light echoes are detected sequentially by the step-movement of a reference mirror, while in FD-OCT the light echoes come at the same time from all axial depths and are detected as modulations in the source spectrum with all the spectral components captured simultaneously. FD-OCT provides faster imaging speed due to its non-scanning fashion compared with TD-OCT.\nConventionally, both the time-domain OCT (TD-OCT) and Fourier-domain OCT (FD-OCT) perform beam steering to scan the lateral plane (x; y). This scanning process assumes a single photo-diode to capture the light each time from a single spatial point. One natural question is that \u0026ldquo;can we capture the whole spatial points in parallel?\u0026rdquo;.
