abstract = {Over the last decade, many methods have been proposed to achieve optical imaging through scattering media. Among them, speckle deconvolution utilizing the optical memory effect of the medium is widely employed due to its advantages in imaging speed and relatively simpler setup. However, practical applications of speckle deconvolution method are rarely demonstrated as most of the existing systems are based on transmission geometry to ensure direct incoherent illumination and easy detection. Here we propose an imaging system in reflection configuration that is able to retrieve the hidden fluorescent object behind a thin scattering media by speckle deconvolution. The object speckle pattern and speckle pattern from a point source (point spread function of the system, PSF) are spectrally separated to facilitate non-invasive image acquisitions. It is shown that, to reconstruct object faithfully, spectral de-correlation and chromatic aberration induced depth de-correlation between the object speckle pattern and the PSF have to be compensated. Speckle correlation is employed to characterize the depth-of-field (DOF) range in this reflection imaging system. Within the DOF, focus and defocus effects in the reconstructed objects are observed when rescaling the PSF onto different axial planes. Beyond the DOF, hidden objects that originally fail in reconstruction can be retrieved by PSF stacking and PSF rescaling. The proposed approach is potentially to find wide applications in biomedical imaging, ranging from deep tissue fluorescence microscopy to small animal imaging.}
